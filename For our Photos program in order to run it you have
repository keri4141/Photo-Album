For our Photos program in order to run it you have to run main.java

You must login first with admin and create a user then you can logout and log back in with the username you created.

Once inside the user subsystem, you can the options of creating, deleting, renaming, and opening the albums in the list view. 

When you open an album it will go to the photoviewer.fxml where you have the options of adding and deleting a photo. Once a photo is added by clicking on the photo you unlock the caption textarea and are able to add/delete tags as well.

A problem that we came across with our photo program is that users cannot have the same photo in a same album.
